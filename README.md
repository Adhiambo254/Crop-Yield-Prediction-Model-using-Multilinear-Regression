# Crop-Yield-Prediction-Model-using-Multilinear-Regression
This project develops a crop yield prediction model using multilinear regression to empower farmers with data-driven insights. Leveraging Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Streamlit, it offers a user-friendly interface for accurate predictions, optimizing agricultural efficiency and sustainability.
## Description:
This GitHub project implements a crop yield prediction model using multilinear regression, aimed at providing farmers and agricultural stakeholders with valuable insights for decision-making and planning. The model utilizes historical crop yield data along with environmental variables such as weather conditions, soil properties, and agricultural practices to forecast crop yields accurately.

## Key Features:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collects historical crop yield data and preprocesses it along with relevant environmental variables.
Feature Engineering: Engineers features that capture the relationship between environmental variables and crop yields, considering factors like seasonality, crop type, and regional variations.
Model Development: Implements multilinear regression techniques to establish predictive relationships between input variables and crop yields.
Model Evaluation: Validates the model's performance using key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (RÂ²) score.
User-Friendly Web Application: Provides a user-friendly web interface where users can input relevant data (e.g., weather forecasts, soil information) and visualize predicted crop yields for different scenarios.
Deployment: Enables deployment of the model using Streamlit or similar frameworks for easy access by farmers and agricultural stakeholders.
Intended Audience:

Farmers and agricultural practitioners seeking data-driven insights for optimizing planting schedules, resource utilization, and risk mitigation.
Agricultural organizations and advisory services interested in leveraging predictive analytics for policy-making and advisory purposes.
Agribusinesses involved in demand forecasting, supply chain optimization, and market analysis within the agricultural sector.
## Technologies Used:

Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Streamlit (for web application deployment)
This GitHub project aims to facilitate data-driven decision-making in agriculture by providing stakeholders with a reliable and accessible crop yield prediction model. Contributions, feedback, and collaborations are welcome to enhance the model's functionality and usability.
